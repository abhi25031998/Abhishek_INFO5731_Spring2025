I feel the time given was enough to complete the assignment but kind of advanced for me. During this assignment I learnt a lot of things ike using functions and advanced coding was very interesting. I felt 6 & 7 questions were very challenging and curious at the same time. I have done my best to learn and complete this assignment. I think, for non-technical students it would be very difficult to complete and little simple codes would help in their learning.'"
